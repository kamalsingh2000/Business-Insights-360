# Business-Insights-360
Atliq hardware company is manufacturer of hardware in many countries , They wants us to make a dashboard so that data informed decision can be taken .
We have made Finance , Sales , Marketing , Supply chain and Executive Dashboard so that each team can get insights from the dashboard .

While Working on It I got domain knowledge also like what is 
gross margin ,gros margin % ,Net Sales , Net Profit ,Year on Year change %

# First looke at into Introduction of each Dashboard 

![Home](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/fde97a6c-509e-4908-b9e1-0484c8c5d0b7)

Each Icon represents each Dahsboard and I have used here Page Navigation , If we select this Icon we will directed to that selected dashboard 

Looke at into first Dashboard that is 

# 1) Finance


![Finance](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/f82537f9-5c8a-4c9d-8b79-1e72b151ad7f)

We got the break down of each components 
Gross sale  , Pre invoice discounts , post invoice discounts , Net sales , Manufacturing cost , freight (exporting cost) , Gross margin ,
and Net Profit , Operational cost (marketing , finance cost)
We can notice that net sales are geting increased year by year But Net Profit are deceasing .
Lets Understand why , since Our operational cost are high means cost marketing of brand is high .
It is okay for startup to spend more money on marketing once company gets popular gross margin will increase and operational cost wii get decrease .
And Also compared last year and current year using trend chart you can see .

# 2) Sales 


![Sales](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/0e00f147-ac1a-401e-b270-10bfbedbfbb0)

Sales Team is more interested in customer performance and Product Performance and Net Sales Since they are given target so they dont care about the
Net Profit.
Here in Customer Performnace I have used the visual Tooltip as shown below 

![tooltip-sales-visuals](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/761c097e-2b7f-44ef-82f0-7fee4ba0e400)

We can get cuistomers net sales and gross margin % trend of all month in selected year using tooltip which gives additional information .

# 3) Marketing 


![Marketing ](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/b0f0d8bd-e224-4734-9c9e-2da891fcfa3d)

In Marketing We have to add a net profit since marketing cost is associated with it 
In this dahsboard , we have provided product and market level breakdown of P and L Components and also 
We have used a Waterfall chart to display breakdown of Gross Margin .
We have used here Bookmark very powerfull tool . It was used to change the Visuals between GM% Vs Net sales  and Net Proft % vs Net sales .


# 4) Supply Chain 


![supply chain](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/ca4df1b4-c875-4e14-baa1-37b8b2a6d864)
shortword used here are 
# 1) EI - Excess Inventory (quantity sole less than forecasted)
# 2) OOS - Out Of Stock (Quantity sole more than forecasted)

Kpi Used here are Net error = forecat_quantity - sold_quantity ,Abs error = Absolute(forecat_quantity - sold_quantity),
Forecast Acuracy = Abs error/Forecast_quantity 
We have found customer level net error and forecast accuracy and risk_measure 

we can get insights like which customer has sold more than what they forecasted and which customer not sold as per forecasted and 
future decision can be taken as per this .


# 5) Executive 

We have given quick view of the scenario in this dashboard and addition to this we have added the market share of the manufacturer also here .

![Executive](https://github.com/kamalsingh2000/Business-Insights-360/assets/84310007/c23cec23-fcaf-4b18-803f-17c6ba57a132)

RC(revenue contribution %)  = Net sales/(total net sales)

We have used Pie chart to get revenue by division and channel (retailer , direct , distributor).67% Of revenue are getting from Retailers .
